WHOWAS <nick> [count] [nick|server]

WHOWAS will show you brief information from the last time
the specified nick was connected or changed nickname.
Depending on the number of times they have connected,
there may be more than one listing for the specified nick.
You can limit how many of those listings will be shown
with the count parameter.

Specifying nick or server as an additional parameter forwards
the query to that server.

The WHOWAS data will expire after time.
