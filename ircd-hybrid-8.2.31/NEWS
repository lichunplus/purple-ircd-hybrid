o) Extbans have been implemented. Currently supported extbans:

   Matching:
  
   $a:<account>   Matches users logged into a matching account.
   $c:<channel>   Matches users that are on the given channel. An additional
                  prefix of either @, %, or + can be specified to test for
                  certain channel privileges.
   $o:<class>     Matches IRC operators that have joined a class
                  matching the mask.
   $r:<realname>  Matches users with a matching realname.
   $s:<server>    Matches users that are connected to a server matching the mask.
   $u:<modes>     Matches users having the specified user modes set or not set.
   $z:<certfp>    Matches users having the given TLS certificate fingerprint.
  
   Acting:
  
   $j:<banmask>   Prevents matching users from joining the channel.
   $m:<banmask>   Blocks messages from matching users. Users with voice
                  or above are not affected.

   --disable-openssl and --disable-gnutls, have been replaced with the --with-tls switch
   which takes one of the following options: 'openssl', 'wolfssl', 'gnutls', and 'none'.

   openssl/libressl -> gnutls -> wolfssl.
o) Fixed segfault with GnuTLS/libgmp in case there's no DH parameters file
   defined in 'serverinfo::ssl_dh_param_file' or if that file is missing

   instead of updating existing ones that are already in use
o) For a full list of all changes in this release, see https://git.io/fjEbq


-- Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.25 (2019-04-24)

-- Noteworthy changes in version 8.2.13 (2016-02-02)

o) Implemented full services support, including but not limited to the

   - Added SVSNICK, and SVSMODE command handlers
   - Added service stamps to NICK/UID messages
   - Added SVS to server capabilities (CAPAB). SVS capable servers can
     deal with extended NICK/UID messages that contain service IDs/stamps.
   - Changed rejected client notices to go to new usermode +j.  These
     previously used usermode +r.
   - Added usermode +r (registered nick) and channelmode +r (registered channel)

   privilege flags. Read doc/reference.conf for further explanation of what
   these flags control
o) Removed Idle-time klines

o) Removed 'general::burst_away' configuration directive. AWAY bursts are now
   controlled via 'connect::flags' explicitly

   file sizes. Log timestamp format is ISO8601 now
o) Added support for remote D-lines
o) Added usermode +H which is basically a replacement for the hidden_admin and
   hidden_oper operator flags. With usermode +H, irc operator status can now
   be hidden even on remote servers
o) Added CIDR support for operator {} blocks
o) Removed the servlink program. ircd-hybrid can now make use of
   SSL/TLS for inter-server communication.
   NOTE: compressed server links are of course still available, but a SSL/TLS
   connection is required, as compression is now handled via OpenSSL
o) Removed 'ssl_server_protocol' configuration directive and
   added 'ssl_client_method' and 'ssl_server_method' instead.
   Both of these options can now be changed at runtime
o) Oper login IDs are no longer limited to NICKLEN*2
o) Removed 'channel::burst_topicwho' configuration option. This feature is now
   enabled by default
